## Environment Setup

- This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to be installed on your system for execution.

- Furthermore, before running the project, you must set up a MySQL database:

1. Install MySQL on your system if it's not already installed. You can download it from [MySQL's official website](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/).

2. Open your MySQL client (such as [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) or command-line client) and create a new database for the project:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE restaurant;
   ```

3. After creating the database, open the config/config.json file in your project directory. Verify and update the development environment configuration to match your database credentials. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```json
"development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "restaurant",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
